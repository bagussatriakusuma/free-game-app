# Challenge Chapter 5 - Synrgy🔥

📌Note: <p>
in this project, i didn't use loading state because of the lack of time and deadlines. this might affect when do the request and fetching response. in the next challenge chapter i'll try to add loading state with shimmer `https://github.com/facebookarchive/shimmer-android`, so it will have the loading state and more looks good👍<br>
and also i might add more feature in the next challenge chapter.

### Library that i used🚀
- `Retrofit` -> networking
- `Coroutines` -> asynchronous
- `Dagger-Hilt` -> dependency injection
- `Datastore` -> store key value (in this project, i store token from user)
- `Navigation components` -> single activity and navigation
- `Splash screen API` -> custom splash screen
- `Glide` -> load and display image from response data
- `Image picker` -> open image or camera
- `Image slider` -> make image slideeeee
